4. Once, 'npm install' is completed, run `npm start` to start the expo and react-native server
5. If it shows a QR code on the terminal as a result of 'npm start' command, then you are good to go!

Ignore the first step on 'Mobile setup' instructions given below if you already have 'Expo' app installed on your phone.
